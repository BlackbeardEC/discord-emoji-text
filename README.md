## Discord emoji text  
  
Simple page with js to convert any text entered into emoji letters (:regional_indicator_a:) with proper spacing to look normal.  
  
## Motivation  
  
I saw people writing in discord messages with emoji regional indicator letters and thought, **I wonder if they went through and clicked each emoji, that would take fore ever**, and wrote this real quick.
